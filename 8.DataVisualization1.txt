Theory:
A. Distribution Plots:
These plots help us to visualise the distribution of data. We can use these plots to understand
the mean, median, range, variance, deviation, etc of the data.
a. Distplot
● Dist plot gives us the histogram of the selected continuous variable.
● It is an example of a univariate analysis.
● We can change the number of bins i.e. number of vertical bars in a histogram

b. Joint Plot
● It is the combination of the distplot of two variables.
● It is an example of bivariate analysis.

● We additionally obtain a scatter plot between the variables to reflect their linear
relationship. We can customise the scatter plot into a hexagonal plot, where, the more
the colour intensity, the more will be the number of observations.

a. c. The Rug Plot
b. The rugplot() is used to draw small bars along the x-axis for each point in the dataset. To plot
a rug plot, you need to pass the name of the column. Let's plot a rug plot for fare.


2. Categorical Plots

b. The Bar Plot
The barplot() is used to display the mean value for each value in a categorical column, against a
numeric column. The first parameter is the categorical column, the second parameter is the
numeric column while the third parameter is the dataset. For instance, if you want to know the
mean value of the age of the male and female passengers, you can use the bar plot as follows.

c. The Count Plot

The count plot is similar to the bar plot, however it displays the count of the categories in a
specific column. For instance, if we want to count the number of males and women passenger
we can do so using count plot as follows:

d. The Box Plot
The box plot is used to display the distribution of the categorical data in the form of quartiles.
The centre of the box shows the median value. The value from the lower whisker to the bottom
of the box shows the first quartile. From the bottom of the box to the middle of the box lies the
second quartile. From the middle of the box to the top of the box lies the third quartile and
finally from the top of the box to the top whisker lies the last quartile.


e. The Violin Plot
The violin plot is similar to the box plot, however, the violin plot allows us to display all the
components that actually correspond to the data point. The violinplot() function is used to plot
the violin plot. Like the box plot, the first parameter is the categorical column, the second
parameter is the numeric column while the third parameter is the dataset.

Advanced Plots:
a. The Strip Plot
The strip plot draws a scatter plot where one of the variables is categorical. We have seen scatter
plots in the joint plot and the pair plot sections where we had two numeric variables. The strip
plot is different in a way that one of the variables is categorical in this case, and for each
category in the categorical variable, you will see a scatter plot with respect to the numeric
column.

b. The Swarm Plot
The swarm plot is a combination of the strip and the violin plots. In the swarm plots, the points
are adjusted in such a way that they don't overlap. Let's plot a swarm plot for the distribution of
age against gender. The swarmplot() function is used to plot the violin plot. Like the box plot,
the first parameter is the categorical column, the second parameter is the numeric column while
the third parameter is the dataset.


1. Matrix Plots
Matrix plots are the type of plots that show data in the form of rows and columns. Heat maps are
the prime examples of matrix plots.
a. Heat Maps
Heat maps are normally used to plot correlation between numeric columns in the form of a
matrix. It is important to mention here that to draw matrix plots, you need to have meaningful
information on rows as well as columns. Let's plot the first five rows of the Titanic dataset to see
if both the rows and column headers have meaningful information.


b. Cluster Map:
In addition to the heat map, another commonly used matrix plot is the cluster map. The
cluster map basically uses Hierarchical Clustering to cluster the rows and columns of the
matrix.
