Theory:
Data Wrangling in Python:
Data Wrangling is the process of gathering, collecting, and transforming Raw data into another
format for better understanding, decision-making, accessing, and analysis in less time. Data
Wrangling is also known as Data Munging.

Importance Of Data Wrangling:
Data Wrangling is a very important step. The below example will explain its importance as :
Books selling Website want to show top-selling books of different domains, according to user
preference. For example, a new user search for motivational books, then they want to show those
motivational books which sell the most or having a high rating, etc.
But on their website, there are plenty of raw data from different users. Here the concept of Data
Munging or Data Wrangling is used. As we know Data is not Wrangled by System. This process
is done by Data Scientists. So, the data Scientist will wrangle data in such a way that they will
sort that motivational books that are sold more or have high ratings or user buy this book with
these package of Books, etc. On the basis of that, the new user will make choice. This will
explain the importance of Data wrangling.

Data wrangling in python deals with the below functionalities:
1. Data exploration: In this process, the data is studied, analyzed and understood by
visualizing representations of data.
2. Dealing with missing values: Most of the datasets having a vast amount of data contain
missing values of NaN, they are needed to be taken care of by replacing them with mean,
mode, the most frequent value of the column or simply by dropping the row having
a NaN value.
3. Reshaping data: In this process, data is manipulated according to the requirements, where
new data can be added or pre-existing data can be modified.
4. Filtering data: Some times datasets are comprised of unwanted rows or columns which are
required to be removed or filtered
5. Other: After dealing with the raw dataset with the above functionalities we get an efficient
dataset as per our requirements and then it can be used for a required purpose like data
analyzing, machine learning, data visualization, model training etc.
