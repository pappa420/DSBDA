First, we will import all the libraries:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Now we will import the dataset and select only age and salary as the features:

dataset =pd.read_csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')

dataset.head()

df=pd.DataFrame(dataset)
df

#X and Y define  

X = df.iloc[:,[2,3]].values
y = df.iloc[:,4].values

print(X[:3,:])
print('-'*15)
print(y[:3])

#splitting dataset into traning set and testing set 

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 0)

print(X_train[:3])
print('-'*15)
print(y_train[:3])

print(X_test[:3])
print('-'*15)
print(y_test[:3])

#feature scaling

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

print(X_train[:3])
print('-'*15)
print(X_test[:3])

#Fitting Logistic Regression Model 

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
classifier = LogisticRegression(random_state = 0)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

print(y_pred)

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,classification_report

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
cl_report=classification_report(y_test,y_pred)

print(cm)

print(cl_report)



Theory:
What is logistic Regression?
Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model
a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression
analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic
model (a form of binary regression). Logistic regression is basically a supervised
classification algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable(or output), y, can take
only discrete values for a given set of features(or inputs), X.
● Dependent variable: The target variable in a logistic regression model, which we are trying to
predict.
● Independent variables: The input characteristics or predictor factors applied to the dependent
variable’s predictions.
● Logistic function: The formula used to represent how the independent and dependent variables
relate to one another. The logistic function transforms the input variables into a probability
value between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood of the dependent variable being 1 or 0.
● Odds: The proportion of an event’s chances of happening to its chances of not happening. The
chances are used in logistic regression to model the connection between the independent and
dependent variables.
● Log-odds: The logistic regression model’s calculation is made simpler by using the logarithm of
the odds.
● Coefficient: The logistic regression model’s estimated parameters, which show how the
independent and dependent variables relate to one another.
● Intercept: A constant term in the logistic regression model, which represents the log-odds when
all independent variables are equal to zero.
● Maximum likelihood estimation: The method used to estimate the coefficients of the logistic
regression model, which maximizes the likelihood of observing the data given the model. ●
Confusion matrix: A table that lists the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and

false negative predictions made by a logistic regression model is used to assess the model’s
performance.
