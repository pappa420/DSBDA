Theory:
There are various techniques to understand your data, And the basic need is you should have
the knowledge of Numpy for mathematical operations and Pandas for data manipulation. We
are using Titanic dataset. For demonstrating some of the techniques we will also use an inbuilt
dataset of seaborn as tips data which explains the tips each waiter gets from different
customers.

Categorical Data:
A variable that has text-based information is referred to as categorical variables. Now
following are various plots which we can use for visualizing Categorical data.
1) CountPlot:
Countplot is basically a count of frequency plot in form of a bar graph. It plots the count of
each category in a separate bar. When we use the pandas’ value counts function on any
column. It is the same visual form of the value counts function. In our data-target variable is
survived and it is categorical so plot a countplot of this.

2) Pie Chart:
The pie chart is also the same as the countplot, only gives us additional information about the
percentage presence of each category in data means which category is getting how much
weightage in data. Now we check about the Sex column, what is a percentage of Male and
Female members traveling.

Numerical Data:
Analyzing Numerical data is important because understanding the distribution of variables
helps to further process the data. Most of the time, we will find much inconsistency with
numerical data so we have to explore numerical variables.
1) Histogram:
A histogram is a value distribution plot of numerical columns. It basically creates bins in
various ranges in values and plots it where we can visualize how values are distributed. We can
have a look where more values lie like in positive, negative, or at the center(mean). Let’s have
a look at the Age column.

2) Distplot:
Distplot is also known as the second Histogram because it is a slight improvement version of
the Histogram. Distplot gives us a KDE(Kernel Density Estimation) over histogram which

explains PDF(Probability Density Function) which means what is the probability of each value
occurring in this column.

3) Boxplot:
Boxplot is a very interesting plot that basically plots a 5 number summary. to get 5 number
summary some terms we need to describe.

1) Scatter Plot:
To plot the relationship between two numerical variables scatter plot is a simple plot to do. Let
us see the relationship between the total bill and tip provided using a scatter plot.

1) Bar Plot:
Bar plot is a simple plot which we can use to plot categorical variable on the x-axis and
numerical variable on y-axis and explore the relationship between both variables. The blacktip
on top of each bar shows the confidence Interval. let us explore P-Class with age.

2) Boxplot:
We have already study about boxplots in the Univariate analysis above. we can draw a separate
boxplot for both the variable. let us explore gender with age using a boxplot.

3) Distplot:
Distplot explains the PDF function using kernel density estimation. Distplot does not have a
hue parameter but we can create it. Suppose we want to see the probability of people with an
age range that of survival probability and find out whose survival probability is high to the age
range of death ratio.
